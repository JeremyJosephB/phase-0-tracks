# Pseudocode: 
# 1. create the data structure in order to hold any data to begin with.
# 2. In the driver code get user input, it's to be able to take anything 
#    so gets.chomp should should work
# 3. store that data in the data structure, "hash[0] = user_input"
#    would be good
# 4. print back the hash.
